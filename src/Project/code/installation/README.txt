### Installation procedure

We may need to install some Python dependencies on your machine. We assume that you are running a Windows machine.

To install these dependencies:

1. Open the Windows Command Prompt as an administator. This is required for the installation. Simply right-click on the Command Prompt app in the startup menu and select 'Run As Administrator'.

2. Navigate to the directory of this readme file (which also contains the Python script setup.py.) in the command prompt.

3. Run 'python -m setup.py'

4. This should install the dependencies. If any problems occur, please email me at dana.kianfar@gmail.com, and paste the error message.
